package trie

// Leaf is what contains the values in the trie. This implementation uses nodes that are
// compacted and do not always reside at the bottom layer of the trie.
// Instead, they are inserted at the first heights where they do not conflict with others.
// This allows the trie to keep a relatively small amount of nodes, instead of having
// many nodes/extensions for each leaf in order to bring it all the way to the bottom
// of the trie.
type Leaf struct {
	hash    [32]byte
	payload [32]byte
}

// Hash returns the leaf hash.
func (l *Leaf) Hash() [32]byte {
	return l.hash
}
